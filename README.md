In modern data-driven world, PDFs are a popular format for transmitting critical information across industries that include business management to healthcare. Despite its perceived security, attackers are increasingly targeting PDFs to introduce malware, posing hazards such as stealing data, monetary damage, and system penetration. This project solves this issue by utilizing machine learning to determine if PDFs are benign or malicious. However, attacker methods are always developing, with one frequent example being the adoption of techniques for evasion to modify machine learning models. Our priority is to combat these evasion assaults, learn how attackers use such approaches, and create countermeasures. Our process include developing Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree models, determining their hyperparameters, and assessing performance metrics like false negative rate and accuracy. Furthermore, we run evasion simulations with datasets to better our understanding and design appropriate countermeasures. This study contributes to improving PDF security, lowering risks, and safeguarding sensitive data across sectors, all while increasing confidence and trust in electronic means of communication.
